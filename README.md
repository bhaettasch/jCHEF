jCHEF - javaConnectedHandleEventFramework
=========

jCHEF is a free and simply to use event handling framework for JAVA programs. You may use it to unify the work with events from different sources.

After creating connectors for new data sources and targets, most of the configuration is done by just adjusting JSON files.

For configuration parsing, jCHEF depends on the JSON.simple library: https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/ There are no other dependencies.
